Dataformat: Setaram3temptime  	#Dataformat in which data are saved. See the readme for all possibilities and examples. 
ROI_h: 10.0, 60.0 	#Region of interest for the heating runs, please indicate the range of temperatures probed by the program. 
ROI_c: 10.0, 60.0 	#Region of interest for the cooling runs, please indicate the range of temperatures probed by the program. 
mass_s: 530.6 		#mass of the sample solution, in mg
mass_r: 523.14 		#mass of the solution in the reference cell, in mg
mass_bb: 0.0 		#[needed for buffer correctoion] mass difference between the buffer solution in the sample cell and in the reference (sample-reference) in the buffer-buffer experiment, in mg. If no buffer-buffer experiment was performed, this line will be ignored.
s_wt: 0.085 		#Concentration of the sample, in weight percent. 1% will be 0.01; 100% is 1.0
Scanrate_h: 0.5		#Scanrate for the heating experiments, in K/min. If the data contain the time and temperature information, this line will be ignored. 
Scanrate_c: 1.2 	#Scanrate for the cooling experiments, in K/min. If the data contain the time and temperature information, this line will be ignored.
bins: 5 		#Size of the bins used to reduce the file size. i.e., a file of length N is reduced to N/bins, whereby bins number of points are averaged.
ROP_h: 15.0, 53.0	#region where the peak is found in the heating scans
ROP_c: 15.0, 42.0	#region where the peak is found in the cooling scans
Mw: 4600 			#[optional]Provide Mw in g/mol for data in J/mol instead of J/g. 
Input: exo-down		#Convention used for input files, can be exo-up or exo-down. 	
Output: exo-down	#Convention used for output files, can be exo-up or exo-down. 
Exo_in_plot: False	#(True or False) If True, an arrow indicating the Exo-up or Exo-down convention will be put in the DSC output plots.
