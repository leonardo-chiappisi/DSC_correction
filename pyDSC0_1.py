"""
Two sets of script dedicated to the reduction of the thermograms from differential scanning calorimetry on simple solutions. 
First version by Aline Cisse
Second version by Leonardo Chiappisi (December 2018)
Edit 2019.02.05: corrected bug in dsc.plot (wrong value for enthalpy displayed) and reads Mw from input file. 
Edit 2019.02.19: dsc.correction function was added. 
Edit 2019.05.02: correction of small bugs in the dsc.correction function and addition of the plot_baseline_data function. 
Edit 2019.05.29: Included input dataformat 3cols and evaluated error in DH from data noise. Correction small bugs. 
Edit 2019.05.30: Small bug correction.
Edit 2019.06.05: Added latin1 encoding in the setaram data formats
Edit 2019.06.07: Small bug corrections.
Edit 2019.06.25: Several information are now included in the output files. Program takes care of exo-up or exo-down convention.  Version number and date will be added to the exported files.
